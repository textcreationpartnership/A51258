         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chapter, called by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>The Vniverſality of Gods free grace to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> and that other, <hi>Of the diſcovery of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood of Chriſt,</hi> ſpecially the 11 Chap. and other books and manuſcripts, which ſuch as had read may ſee and know the falſeneſs of this charge, only I have not been ſo large in preſſing the receiving of ſuch reproofs and corrections, with the danger of not receiving, which as it is no prejudice to that ſayd here, ſo I may give ſome reaſon why I thus do it now, and did not ſo fully do it then.</p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe I had not ſalt enough with its ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my ſelf, to do it rightly, ſo as it might be ſuitable to the words given by inſpiration of the Almighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for doctrine reproof, correction and inſtruction in righteouſneſs; Firſt doctrine, next

with that reproof, and then with both correction, and ſo inſtruction in righteouſneſs: And had I yet more ſalt in my ſelf, with its ſaltneſs, I ſhould do it more profitably in this order, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. which yet in my weakneſs I have aſſayed.</p>
                     <p>2. Becauſe I conceived ſome not able to be are home preſſing and plain reproofs and corrections to be received, with the terror of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt refuſers, (<hi>correction being grievous to him that is out of the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Prov. 15. 19.) and ſo I was willing rather to forbear then to break in peices, <hi>but waite to ſee if God by grace would at any time humble and ſo fit them to receive reproof,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 34. 25. 26.</p>
                     <p>3. Becauſe many inclining towards, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and loving the goſpel and doctrine thereof, who are yet weak and tender, and ready to be affrighted with a hard word, and ſuch I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pity and have compaſſion on, and deal with them with tenderneſs and the ſpirit of meekneſs, and ſo to ſpeak as they may be able to bear it, as our Saviour did, <hi>Iude</hi> 22. <hi>Gall.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 12. And now the goſpel hath been by many plainly diſplayed, but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</p>
                     <p>4. Some there are ſtiff and wilful in ſome evil way or ſelf deſign, or ſome open ſins, or magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſome deluſions who are to be rebuked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and ſharply, and to be ſtriven with, to ſave them with terror and fear, <hi>to pluck them as brands out of the fire,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 20. Tit. 1. 13. <hi>Iude</hi> 23. And if we look at the Metaphor ſalt,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96100:43"/>
we know it is not to be applyed alike to all meats to be eaten, neither for quantity, nor alike mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of rubbing and a preſſing it on, nor alike meaſure in all meats it is eaten with, but as need is, ſome more ſome leſs, and the ſame may I ſay for the diſcovering reproofs of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with its effects and corrections to make them take place, ſo that where more corruption and filth appears, to be purged out, there is need of more large and through preſſing theſe reproofs and corrections to be received: And ſo if I ſee now more in my ſelf, and others needing it, it is goſpel-like for me to aſſay it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore take it rightly and ſtumble not at it; if I diſcern the appearance of more corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my ſelf, and other beleivers and profeſſors of the goſpel then formerly, though I have been plain in this way: we have the doctrine of the goſpel made known to us, and the reproofs of inſtruction therewith extended to us, he oft knocking at our hearts, and yet we while theſe reproofs have been gently preſt on us, have not ſo received them as to turn at his reproofs; no nor yet when in love he hath corrected us, we have not received correction; no though to hide pride from us and break us of our enterprizes and deſigns; he hath been afflicting with divers ſorts of leſſer judgements, forerunners of his four ſore ſore judgements to bow our hearts, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us to humble our ſelves and ſeek his face, before the decree come forth, that we might be hid in the day of his anger, yet we have not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96100:44"/>
ſo received his reproofs and corrections, as to turn thereat, and draw nigh to him and put our truſt in him, yea when in ſome diſtreſſes we have cryed to him he hath given us peace, and we ſaid we would no more tranſgreſs, yet we have turned again to folly: And though he hath ſmitten others with the peſtilence further off to warn us, yet we took not warning, but have gone on ſtill in our own wayes, till he (though with ſlow beginnings at the firſt) hath brought the peſtilence among us. And if yet thoſe very ſins for which he hath both threatned and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the peſtilence (and his other three ſore judgements <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14. 21.) be found gone on in by us, need we not to be much ſalted and humbled under his reproofs and corrections? let us try and ſee</p>
